82.0,tot,1.0,"I believe that the focus on climate change has been exaggerated and often distracts from more pressing and immediate issues facing humanity, such as poverty, healthcare, and education. Many proposed solutions, like drastic policy changes and economic upheaval, could harm economies and livelihoods without guaranteeing significant impact on climate. Instead of prioritizing climate alarmism, we should invest in innovation and technology that can address environmental issues without sacrificing progress and development. It's important to critically assess the data and consider the broader picture of human welfare rather than focusing solely on climate narratives.",8.65583018675814e+40,1.9999763474101229,0.00029236657682847497,,,4.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, posing serious threats to ecosystems, economies, and human health. The scientific consensus is clear: human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are driving unprecedented changes in our climate. These changes result in extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and altered agricultural patterns, impacting food security and biodiversity. 

Addressing climate change requires urgent collective action, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy, and promoting sustainable practices. Furthermore, it necessitates global cooperation and equitable solutions to support vulnerable communities most affected by climate impacts. The longer we delay, the more severe the consequences will be for future generations. It's imperative that we prioritize climate action now to create a sustainable future.",1.6388430958156042,4.99999999999787,5.9367717297288e-11,,
