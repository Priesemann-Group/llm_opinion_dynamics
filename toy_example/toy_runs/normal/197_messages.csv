197.0,tot,2.0,"I believe that while environmental issues are important, the emphasis on climate change often overshadows other pressing concerns that deserve equal attention. There are natural climate fluctuations that have occurred throughout Earth's history, and many argue that humanity's ability to adapt is more crucial than trying to control a complex system that's influenced by numerous factors. Additionally, the policies proposed to combat climate change can sometimes lead to economic challenges and may not always benefit the average person. I think we should focus on a balanced approach that considers a wider range of environmental and socioeconomic issues rather than prioritizing climate change above all else.",2.129183291771717,2.001500959272766,0.011265624584515214,,,3.0,"Climate change is a complex issue that prompts a wide range of opinions and perspectives.
