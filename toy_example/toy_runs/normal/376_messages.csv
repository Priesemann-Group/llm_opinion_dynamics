376.0,tot,4.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, posing serious threats to ecosystems, economies, and human health. The scientific consensus is clear: human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are driving unprecedented changes in our climate. These changes result in extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and altered agricultural patterns, impacting food security and biodiversity. 

Addressing climate change requires urgent collective action, including transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable practices. Furthermore, equitable policy-making is essential to support vulnerable communities and ensure a just transition. By prioritizing environmental stewardship and fostering innovation, we can mitigate the impacts of climate change and create a more sustainable future for all.",1.6868729219389806,4.99999999999344,1.7548535115805332e-10,,,1.0,"I believe that the focus on climate change has been exaggerated and often distracts from more immediate and pressing issues facing humanity, such as poverty, healthcare, and education. Many climate models are speculative, and the economic impact of drastic measures to combat climate change can be detrimental. We should prioritize innovation and adaptation rather than imposing regulations that might hinder growth and development. Ultimately, it's crucial to maintain a balanced perspective on environmental issues without sacrificing progress in other vital areas.",1.7653761663303293,1.9999990925145077,6.808340965617813e-05,,
