401.0,tot,4.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, posing serious threats to ecosystems, economies, and human health. The scientific consensus is clear: human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are driving unprecedented changes in our climate. These changes result in extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and altered agricultural patterns, impacting food security and biodiversity. 

Addressing climate change requires urgent collective action, including transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable practices. Furthermore, equitable policy-making is essential to support vulnerable communities and ensure a just transition. By prioritizing environmental stewardship and fostering innovation, we can mitigate the impacts of climate change and create a sustainable future for generations to come. Time is of the essence, and the choices we make today will shape the world of tomorrow.",1.670148734448936,4.999999999999217,2.2623663364206247e-11,,,2.0,"I believe that while environmental issues are important, the narrative around climate change often exaggerates the urgency and impact. Many natural climate fluctuations have occurred throughout Earth's history without human influence. Economic growth, technological advancement, and human ingenuity are crucial in addressing various challenges. Instead of focusing solely on climate change, we should prioritize a balanced approach that considers economic stability, energy needs, and innovation alongside environmental stewardship.",1.7845730359552525,2.0019272325188138,0.013977476443649375,,
