535.0,tot,5.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, affecting not only the environment but also public health, economies, and social equity. The evidence is undeniable—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and melting ice caps are all consequences of human activity. Urgent action is needed, not just from governments but also from individuals and businesses to reduce carbon emissions and shift towards sustainable practices. The time to act is now, as the longer we wait, the more severe the repercussions will be for future generations. It's essential to foster awareness and advocate for policies that prioritize the planet's health. Every action counts.",1.862949475988187,4.999999999998121,5.262677460474549e-11,,,2.0,"I believe that while environmental issues are important, the emphasis on climate change often overshadows other pressing concerns that deserve equal attention. The notion that climate change is the most urgent problem can lead to ineffective policies that prioritize emissions reduction over economic development and social needs. Many regions still face poverty, health crises, and infrastructure challenges that are immediate and require resources. Additionally, the Earth's climate has always been subject to natural changes, and history shows that societies have adapted to these changes over time. Instead of focusing exclusively on climate change, we should adopt a more balanced approach that addresses a range of environmental and societal issues simultaneously.",4.364849111836703e+35,2.006740621339929,0.04046487641036379,,
