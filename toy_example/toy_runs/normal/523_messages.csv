523.0,tot,5.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, affecting not only the environment but also public health, economies, and social equity. The evidence is undeniable—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and melting ice caps are all consequences of human activity. Urgent action is needed, not just from governments but also from individuals and businesses to reduce carbon emissions and shift towards sustainable practices. The time to act is now, as the longer we wait, the more severe the repercussions will be for future generations. It's essential to foster awareness and advocate for policies that prioritize the planet's health. Every action counts.",1.8566663192383044,4.99999999999787,5.936771729732254e-11,,,1.0,"I believe that the focus on climate change has been exaggerated and often distracts from more immediate and pressing issues facing humanity, such as poverty, healthcare, and education. Many climate models are speculative, and the economic impact of drastic measures to combat climate change can be detrimental. We should prioritize innovation and adaptation rather than imposing regulations that might hinder growth and development. Ultimately, it's crucial to maintain a balanced perspective on environmental issues without sacrificing progress in other vital areas.",1.7465426533243338,1.9999933436478645,9.4533425019157e-05,,
