244.0,tot,2.0,"I believe that while environmental issues are important, the emphasis on climate change often overshadows other pressing concerns that deserve equal attention. There are natural climate fluctuations that have occurred throughout Earth's history, and many argue that humanity's ability to adapt is significant. Rather than focusing solely on climate change, we should prioritize economic development, technological innovation, and improving living standards globally, which can also contribute to better environmental stewardship. Addressing immediate human needs can lead to more sustainable long-term solutions without the alarmism often tied to climate narratives.",2.1781363274581262,2.0052189416716497,0.03266468183052461,,,5.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, affecting not only the environment but also public health, economies, and social equity. The evidence is undeniable—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and melting ice caps are all consequences of human activity. Urgent action is needed, not just from governments but also from individuals and businesses to reduce carbon emissions and shift towards sustainable practices. The time to act is now, as the longer we wait, the more severe the repercussions will be for future generations. It's essential to foster awareness and advocate for policies that prioritize the planet's health. Every action counts.",1.8726271288344412,4.999999999998121,5.262677460474549e-11,,
