148.0,tot,2.0,"I believe that while environmental issues are important, the emphasis on climate change often overshadows other pressing concerns that deserve equal attention. The notion that climate change is the most urgent problem can lead to ineffective policies that prioritize emissions reduction over economic development and social needs. Many regions face immediate challenges like poverty, health care, and education, which should be addressed in parallel. Focusing solely on climate change may divert resources and attention from these critical areas. Additionally, I think that the narrative around climate change is sometimes exaggerated, leading to fear rather than rational discussion about all potential solutions. A balanced approach is essential for truly sustainable progress.",1.2524530365589934e+35,2.0808378890215087,0.2858730794433737,,,1.0,"I believe that the focus on climate change has been exaggerated and often distracts from more pressing and immediate issues facing humanity, such as poverty, healthcare, and education. Many proposed solutions, like drastic policy changes and economic upheaval, could harm economies without solving the problem effectively.
