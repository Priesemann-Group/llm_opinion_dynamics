509.0,tot,5.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, affecting not only the environment but also public health, economies, and social equity. The evidence is undeniable—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and melting ice caps are all consequences of human activity. Urgent action is needed, not just from governments but also from individuals and businesses to reduce carbon emissions and shift towards sustainable practices. The time to act is now, as the longer we wait, the more severe the repercussions will be for future generations. It's essential to foster awareness and advocate for policies that prioritize the planet's health. Every action counts.",1.8673537733662413,4.999999999998121,5.262677460475772e-11,,,1.0,"I believe that the focus on climate change has been exaggerated and often distracts from more pressing and immediate issues facing humanity, such as poverty, healthcare, and education. Many proposed solutions, like drastic policy changes and economic upheaval, could harm economies and livelihoods without guaranteeing significant impact on climate. Instead of prioritizing climate alarmism, we should invest in innovation and technology that can address environmental issues without sacrificing progress and development. It's important to critically assess the data and consider the broader picture of human welfare rather than focusing solely on climate narratives.",8.633325427965223e+40,1.9999650366351422,0.00040394538279730835,,
