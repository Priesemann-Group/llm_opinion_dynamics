414.0,tot,4.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, posing serious threats to ecosystems, economies, and human health. The scientific consensus is clear: human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are driving unprecedented changes in our climate. These changes result in extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and altered agricultural patterns, impacting food security and biodiversity. 

Addressing climate change requires urgent collective action, including a transition to renewable energy, sustainable transportation, and effective conservation strategies. It’s essential for individuals, governments, and businesses to adopt sustainable practices and advocate for policies that mitigate climate impacts. By fostering innovation and investing in green technologies, we can work towards a more resilient and sustainable future for generations to come.",1.7025557061147925,4.999999999996021,1.0842669486254623e-10,,,2.0,"I believe that while environmental issues are important, the emphasis on climate change often overshadows other pressing concerns that deserve equal attention. The notion that climate change is the most urgent problem can lead to ineffective policies that prioritize it over critical economic, social, and infrastructural challenges. We should focus on a balanced approach to improving overall quality of life and addressing immediate concerns, rather than prioritizing climate change to the detriment of other issues.",1.7403442445498277e+50,2.0477584441542076,0.19250554390624716,,
