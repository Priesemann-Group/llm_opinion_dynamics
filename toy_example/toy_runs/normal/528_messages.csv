528.0,tot,5.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, affecting not only the environment but also public health, economies, and social equity. The evidence is undeniable—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and melting ice caps are all consequences of human activity. Urgent action is needed, not just from governments but also from individuals and businesses to reduce carbon emissions and shift towards sustainable practices. The time to act is now, as the longer we wait, the more severe the repercussions will be for future generations. It's essential to foster awareness and advocate for policies that prioritize the planet's health. Every step towards sustainability is a step towards a viable future.",1.8976375543015689,4.999999999994891,1.379453390435359e-10,,,2.0,"I believe that while environmental issues are important, the emphasis on climate change often overshadows other pressing concerns that deserve equal attention. There are natural climate fluctuations that have occurred throughout Earth's history, and many argue that humanity's ability to adapt is more crucial than trying to control a complex system that's influenced by numerous factors. Additionally, the policies proposed to combat climate change can sometimes lead to economic challenges and may not always benefit the average person. I think we should focus on a balanced approach that considers a wider range of environmental and socioeconomic issues rather than concentrating primarily on climate change.",2.2649290594734173,2.0015009736954155,0.011266691626258353,,
