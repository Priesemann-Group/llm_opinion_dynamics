143.0,tot,2.0,"I believe that while environmental issues are important, the emphasis on climate change often overshadows other pressing concerns that deserve equal attention. The notion that climate change is the most urgent problem can lead to ineffective policies that prioritize emissions reduction over economic development and social needs. Many regions still face poverty, health crises, and infrastructure challenges that are immediate and require resources. Additionally, the Earth's climate has always been subject to natural changes, and history shows that societies have adapted to these changes over time. Instead of focusing exclusively on climate change, we should adopt a more balanced approach that addresses a range of environmental and societal issues simultaneously.",4.3457490751089286e+35,2.0294547707082624,0.1331082289504268,,,1.0,"I believe that the focus on climate change has been exaggerated and often distracts from more immediate and pressing issues facing humanity, such as poverty, healthcare, and education. Many proposed solutions, like drastic emissions cuts or the shift to renewable energy, can have significant economic repercussions without necessarily solving the underlying problems. It’s important to prioritize policies that promote economic growth and innovation rather than prioritizing climate narratives that may not reflect the complexity of our world. We should address environmental concerns, but not at the expense of ignoring other critical needs.",4.772449620991861e+41,1.999996758224244,0.00011978164300265405,,
