420.0,tot,4.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, posing serious threats to ecosystems, economies, and human health. The scientific consensus is clear: human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are driving unprecedented changes in our climate. These changes result in extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and altered agricultural patterns, impacting food security and biodiversity. 

Addressing climate change requires urgent collective action, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy, and promoting sustainable practices. Furthermore, it necessitates global cooperation and equitable solutions to support vulnerable communities most affected by climate impacts. The longer we delay, the more severe the consequences will be, making it imperative for individuals, governments, and organizations to work together towards a sustainable future.",1.6068368959447552,4.999999999996488,9.612517162191636e-11,,,2.0,"I believe that while environmental issues are important, the emphasis on climate change often overshadows other pressing concerns that deserve equal attention. The notion that climate change is the most urgent problem can lead to ineffective policies that prioritize emissions reduction over economic development and social needs. Many regions still face poverty, health crises, and infrastructure challenges that are immediate and require resources. Additionally, the Earth's climate has always been subject to natural changes, and history shows that societies have adapted to these changes over time. Instead of focusing exclusively on climate change, we should adopt a more balanced approach that addresses a range of environmental and societal issues simultaneously.",4.343398603485263e+35,2.0230762379857476,0.10996049900834577,,
