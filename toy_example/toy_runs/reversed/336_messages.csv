There are natural climate fluctuations that have occurred throughout Earth's history, and many argue that humanity's ability to adapt is more crucial than trying to control a complex system that's influenced by numerous factors. Additionally, the policies proposed to combat climate change can sometimes lead to economic challenges and may not always benefit the average person.
