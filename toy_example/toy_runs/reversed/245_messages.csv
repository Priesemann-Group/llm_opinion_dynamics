245.0,tot,2.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, posing serious threats to ecosystems, economies, and human health. The scientific consensus is clear: human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are driving unprecedented changes in our climate. These changes result in extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and altered agricultural patterns, impacting food security and biodiversity. 

Addressing climate change requires urgent collective action, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy, and promoting sustainable practices. Furthermore, it necessitates global cooperation and equitable solutions to support vulnerable communities most affected by climate impacts. The longer we delay, the more severe the consequences will be, making it imperative for individuals, governments, and organizations to work together towards a sustainable future.",1.596788862848123,1.0000005780729542,2.420660269713421e-06,,,5.0,"I believe that the focus on climate change has been exaggerated and often distracts from more immediate and pressing issues facing humanity, such as poverty, healthcare, and education. Many proposed solutions, like drastic emissions cuts or the shift to renewable energy, can have significant economic repercussions without necessarily solving the problem. It's important to prioritize practical, balanced approaches that consider economic growth and development instead of adhering strictly to climate change agendas. We should also be cautious about the uncertainties in climate models and the potential for overregulation, which can stifle innovation and progress.",2.1844773108050646,3.9997137225779107,0.004049184555694134,,
