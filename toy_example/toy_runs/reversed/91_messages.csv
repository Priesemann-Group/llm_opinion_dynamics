91.0,tot,1.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, affecting ecosystems, human health, and global economies. The overwhelming scientific consensus shows that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the primary drivers of this crisis. Immediate and collective action is essential to mitigate its impacts, transition to renewable energy sources, and promote sustainable practices. Addressing climate change not only protects the planet but also fosters economic growth and social equity. It's crucial for individuals, businesses, and governments to collaborate and prioritize this challenge for a livable future.",1.5495467726244447,1.0000001656071553,7.452297864142187e-07,,,4.0,"I believe that while environmental issues are important, the emphasis on climate change often overshadows other pressing concerns that deserve equal attention. The notion that climate change is the most urgent problem can lead to ineffective policies that prioritize emissions reduction over economic development and social needs. Many regions still face poverty, health crises, and infrastructure challenges that are immediate and require resources. Additionally, the Earth's climate has always been subject to natural changes, and history shows that societies have adapted to these changes over time. Instead of focusing exclusively on climate change, we should adopt a more balanced approach that addresses a range of environmental and societal issues simultaneously.",4.381000093360458e+35,2.4509857108559294,0.5808941700512759,,
