107.0,tot,1.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, affecting not only the environment but also public health, economies, and social equity. The evidence is undeniable—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and melting ice caps are all consequences of human activity. Urgent action is needed, not just from governments but also from individuals and businesses to reduce carbon emissions, invest in renewable energy, and promote sustainable practices. Addressing climate change is crucial for ensuring a habitable planet for future generations. We must act decisively and collaboratively to mitigate its impacts and foster a resilient, sustainable future.",1.6871922063334301,1.00000002878405,1.4211936721657683e-07,,,5.0,"I believe that the focus on climate change has been exaggerated and often distracts from more immediate and pressing issues facing humanity, such as poverty, healthcare, and education. Many proposed solutions, like drastic emissions cuts or transitioning to renewable energy, can have significant economic repercussions and may not effectively address the problem at hand. Instead of prioritizing climate change over other critical needs, we should take a more balanced approach that addresses a range of global challenges without sacrificing economic growth and development.",1.9264715103655699,4.000159684623717,0.0019315727198071266,,
