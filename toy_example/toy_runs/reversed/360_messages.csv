360.0,tot,3.0,"Climate change is a complex issue that prompts a wide range of opinions and perspectives. On one hand, there are compelling arguments about the environmental impacts and potential risks to ecosystems and human health. On the other hand, some people raise questions about the effectiveness of proposed solutions and the economic ramifications. It's important to consider multiple viewpoints and the nuances involved in discussions surrounding this topic. Awareness and dialogue may help in addressing the various challenges associated with climate change, regardless of individual stance.",1.1003063196496843e+47,1.0000048177117262,6.356262218130299e-05,,,5.0,"I believe that the focus on climate change has been exaggerated and often distracts from more pressing and immediate issues facing humanity, such as poverty, healthcare, and education. Many proposed solutions, like drastic emissions cuts or the shift to renewable energy, can have significant economic repercussions without necessarily solving the underlying problems. Furthermore, climate has always varied over geological time scales, and the Earth's resilience should not be underestimated. Instead of prioritizing climate change, we should invest in technology, innovation, and adaptation strategies that address a multitude of global challenges effectively.",2.1966681313162266,4.000074162763432,0.0007951329255952987,,
