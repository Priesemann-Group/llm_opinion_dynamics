493.0,tot,4.0,"I believe that while environmental issues are important, the emphasis on climate change often overshadows other pressing concerns that deserve equal attention.

Instead of focusing exclusively on climate change, we should adopt a more balanced approach that addresses a range of environmental and societal issues simultaneously.",4.323092745487396e+35,2.6479038555035808,0.7012652246581385,,,5.0,"I believe that the focus on climate change has been exaggerated and often misrepresented.
