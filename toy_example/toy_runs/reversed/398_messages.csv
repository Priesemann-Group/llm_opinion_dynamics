398.0,tot,4.0,"I believe that while environmental issues are important, the emphasis on climate change often overshadows other pressing concerns that deserve equal attention. The notion that climate change is the most urgent problem can lead to ineffective policies that prioritize emissions reduction over economic development and social needs. Many regions still face poverty, health crises, and infrastructure challenges that are immediate and require resources. Additionally, the Earth's climate has always been subject to natural changes, and history shows that societies have adapted to these changes over time. Instead of focusing exclusively on climate change, we should adopt a more balanced approach that addresses a range of environmental and societal issues simultaneously.",4.360367892067213e+35,3.1222270254844364,0.786731902279839,,,1.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, affecting not only the environment but also public health, economies, and social equity. The evidence is undeniable—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and melting ice caps are all consequences of human activity. Urgent action is needed, not just from governments but also from individuals and businesses to reduce carbon emissions, invest in renewable energy, and promote sustainable practices. Addressing climate change is crucial for ensuring a habitable planet for future generations. We must act decisively and collaboratively to mitigate its impacts and foster a resilient, sustainable future.",1.6838262361373015,1.0000003093865657,1.3438954693980703e-06,,
