205.0,tot,2.0,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, posing serious threats to ecosystems, economies, and human health. The scientific consensus is clear: human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are driving unprecedented changes in our climate. These changes result in extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and altered agricultural patterns, impacting food security and biodiversity. 

Addressing climate change requires urgent collective action, including transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable practices. Furthermore, equitable policy-making is essential to support vulnerable communities and ensure a just transition. By prioritizing environmental stewardship and fostering innovation, we can mitigate the impacts of climate change and create a more sustainable future for all.",1.695378832724202,1.0000000197813532,9.952404542030942e-08,,,4.0,"I believe that while environmental issues are important, the emphasis on climate change often overshadows other pressing concerns that deserve equal attention. There are natural climate fluctuations that have occurred throughout Earth's history, and many argue that humanity's ability to adapt is significant. Rather than focusing solely on climate change, we should prioritize economic development, technological innovation, and improving living standards globally, which can also contribute to better environmental stewardship. Addressing immediate human needs can lead to more sustainable long-term solutions without the alarmism often tied to climate narratives.",2.207607273410316,3.99209289425249,0.04483364036912343,,
